Healthy Life App

What it is:

School Project
Android application for the user to store healthy recipes sorted by food type - currently contains a few recipes

What I Learned:

- How to use Android Studio
- Creating separate pages for the app
- storing data in a SQLite database
- how to 'add to and delete from' the data base
- adding images to the pages as well as buttons
- use of buttons to go to next page, or to access the stored data
- user 'login page' - currently has no validation checks for this and does not require a name to continue to main app
  - this function was simply for personalization of the app and does not access any public domains
